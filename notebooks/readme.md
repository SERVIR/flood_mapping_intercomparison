This folder contains Google Colaboratory Notebooks (modules) that will allow you to replicate our workflow. 

In order to run these notebooks you will need a Google Earth Engine account, as well as a Google Cloud Project. 
You will also need an area of interest and a specific date of interest for when a flood occurred that you wish to study

Module 1 will help you find the intersection of the footprints of Sentinel-1 and HLS overpasses, as well as quantify the cloud cover from each input satellite for this area.

In Module 2, we will get the flood map for the region of interest created by the HydroSAR software. 

In Module 3, we will get the flood map for the region of interest created by the HYDRAFloods software. 

In Module 4, we will get the other flood products (DSWx-HLS, DSWx-S1, MCDWD, GFM, VFM,) available for the flood event of interest. Please note that only some flood products will be available depending on the date of interest for your flood. 
Consult the spreadsheet located in the main folder to determine which flood products will be available at certain times. 

In Module 5, we will harmonize the different flood products and visualize them. 

In Module 6, we will distribute different points within our area of interest in order to conduct an accuracy assessment. 

In Module 7, we will discuss how to collect reference data in Collect Earth Online. 

In Module 8, we will examine the accuracy of different flood products based on our reference data. We will examine the accuracy of the flood products across different land cover types and slope regimes.
