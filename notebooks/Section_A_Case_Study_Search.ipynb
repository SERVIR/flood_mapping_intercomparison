        "This script will take as an input a csv file containing flood events. In this case, a CSV file was downloaded from the [EM-DAT](https://www.emdat.be/) website. Then, various columns were added to this CSV file. This includes a column called \"adm0\", which contains the name of the country as it appears in the [FAO GAUL](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/FAO_GAUL_2015_level0) dataset. It also added a column called \"adm1\", that contains the name of the province(s) affected by a particular flood event. Finally, it has a column called \"adm2\" which contains the name of the district(s) affected by a particular flood event. For adm1 and adm2, the spelling must match the spelling of the districts/contries as they appear in the GAUL dataset. Each flood event will contain a time period of interest and a region of interest. If there is more than one district or province, they must be entered in as a comma-separated list (no spaces).\n",
