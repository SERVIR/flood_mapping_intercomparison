        "This script will take as an input a csv file containing flood events. In this case, a CSV file was downloaded from the [EM-DAT](https://www.emdat.be/) website. Then, various columns were added to this CSV file. This includes a column called \"adm0\", which contains the name of the country as it appears in the [FAO GAUL](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/FAO_GAUL_2015_level0) dataset. It also added a column called \"adm1\", that contains the name of the province(s) affected by a particular flood event. Finally, it has a column called \"adm2\" which contains the name of the district(s) affected by a particular flood event. For adm1 and adm2, the spelling must match the spelling of the districts/contries as they appear in the GAUL dataset. Each flood event will contain a time period of interest and a region of interest. If there is more than one district or province, they must be entered in as a comma-separated list (no spaces).\n",

        "4. percent_coverage: This function will determine the proportion of the area covered by a satellite footprint to the area of the region of interest. This function is used for Sentinel-1\n",
        "5. viirs_and_modis: This function will determine the proportion of the area for which both viirs and modis had clear observations of the ground.\n",
        "6. all_clouds: This function will determine the proportion of the region of interest for which viirs, modis, and HLS **ALL** had clear observations of the ground\n",
        "7. date_list_constructor: This function will take the start date and end date of the flood event as defined in our input csv file and create a list of ee.Date objects containing all dates in between the start and end date. This list of dates will be used so that we can run the above six functions for each date of each flood event contained in our input CSV.\n",
        "8. string_constructor: This function will take a year, month, and day, and create a string in \"YYYY-MM-dd\" format, which will facilitate the creation of ee.Date objects from the input CSV.\n",
        "9. region_merger: This function will take a list of regions (defined as featureCollection objects in Earth Engine) and merge them into a single feature collection. This will use the \"adm0\", \"adm1\", and \"adm2\" columns as mentioned in the introduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use the functions above to create an output CSV. For each flood event we will have a new column for each day that will tell us the outputs of Functions 1-6 above. In the case that there is a Sentinel-1 and a HLS overpass on a certain day, it will tell us what proportion of the region covered by both Sentinel-1 and HLS is free of clouds for viirs, modis, AND HLS. This will help us find our golden goose flood event -- the one with (1) an HLS overpass, (2) a Sentinel-1 overpass, and (3) the highest percentage for which viirs, modis, and HLS all have a clear view of the ground.\n",
